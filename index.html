                                    <h3>A Roleplaying Game...</h3>
                                    <p>...consists of a game moderator (GM) describing a situation, you asking clarifying questions, then telling what your characters do.</p>
                                    <p>As the result, GM adjusts the situation and the process repeats.</p>
                                    <h4>Taking Risk</h4>
                                    <p>If failure is possible, GM may ask you to make a roll of some difficulty ranging from fair to brutal.</p>
                                    <p>To do that, roll dice based on a relevant aspect, ranging from poor to excellent.</p>
                                    <h4>Bonuses</h4>
                                    <p>“+1 to x” means that value x increases by 1. Bonuses don’t stack! +2 to x plus +1 to x equals +2 to x.</p>
                                    <h4>Dice!</h4>
                                    <p>“3dx keep 2” means “roll 3 6-sided dice and keep any two”.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Strength</strong>. Exert force.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Dexterity</strong>. Avoid force.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Build</strong>. Resist force.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cool</strong>. Control force.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Advantage</h4>
                                    <p>
                                    <strong>Advantage</strong> reduces difficulty by one category. Being <strong>prepared</strong> increases an aspect by one rank. <strong>Disadvantage</strong> and <strong>blindsidedness</strong> have the opposite effect.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Aspects</h4>
                                    <p>Aspects are divided into <strong>skills</strong> and <em>basic aspects</em>. One basic aspect is <em>good</em>, the rest are either all <em>average</em> or one <em>poor</em>, one <em>average</em> and one <em>good</em>.</p>
                                    <p>One skill is <em>average</em> and two are <em>good</em>.</p>
                                    <p>One of good skills has a <strong>specialisation</strong> which is <em>elite</em>.</p>
                                    <h4>Features</h4>
                                    <p>Each character has three features, which are any combination of active, passive and material.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Active</strong>. Suffer <em>stress</em> or make a roll to achieve a major effect.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Passive</strong>. A minor constant effect and an aspect that has <em>elite</em> rank under some conditions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Material</strong>. Character's special posession and the unique ways they use those.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Stress</h3>
                                    <p>When something really bad happens to your character, they suffer <strong>stress</strong>. After they take their 7th point of stress, they become decomissioned. For each additional stress taken, they lose an aspect rank.</p>

                                        <li><em>Suffer</em> 1 stress to become a creature of a similar size or enter an oil lamp in an ephemeral form (exit it for free).</li>
                                        <li>You can <em>always</em> whisper short phrases to those you see and hear their reply. You <em>excel</em> at eavesdropping.</li>

                            It has the following primary design goals:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Succinctness</strong>. Core rules fit on an index card and it's enough to generate interesting choices.</li>
                                <li><strong>Variance</strong>. No matter how small the rule set that is used at the table, the nuance of the situations described is captured mechanically.</li>
                                <li><strong>Crunch</strong>. Players who want to enjoy numeric and tactical aspects of tabletop roleplaying games have tools to do so.</li>
                                <!--li><strong>Make d12 useful.</strong> I'm only half-joking. -->
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            And the following secondary design goals:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Modularity</strong>. Depending on the group's preferences, any amount of rules cards can be used to dial the specificity of gameplay.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rules ownership</strong>. Players who like to have rules to help judge the outcome of a situation can take over some rules from the GM and be responsible for application of those.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optimisation</strong>. Players who want to maximise or optimise some aspects of their characters can do so.</li>
                                <li><strong>Boundaries</strong>. The system doesn't allow for indefinitely stacking bonuses; everything is bounded.</li>
                            </ul>

                            It achieves primary goals the following way:

                            <h3>Succinctness</h3>
                            <p>
                            Core rules establish gameplay loop so that a person who doesn't know what TTRPGs are can understand the big idea.
                            They establish basic character attributes in terms of how equipped are they to deal with the forces, external and internal.
                            Finally, they establish a basic resource for the game: <em>stress</em>.
                            Now, by gust generating vectors of basic attributes, people can enjoy "lawful" roleplaying!
                            </p>
                            <h3>Variance</h3>
                            <p>
                            We enable variance at the core system level by having two simple-to-understand dials:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Aspect score, which shows how well-equipped is a character to deal with the situation at hand. It spans from "poor" to "elite".</li>
                                <li>Difficulty, which shows how hard it is to perform given actions in general. It spans from "fair" to "brutal".</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                            We have two dials instead of just one to add a tool for players to have an impact on variance in "advantage / disadvantage" and "preparedness / blindsidedness", which alter each of the two dials.
                            If players are actively taking actions or otherwise seek advantegous position, it helps to create varied play, where an optimal action in one situation is drastically different from one in a <em>similar</em> situation, but with slightly different initial conditions.
                            Two dials also famously address the problem of systems like Gumshoe, where skills and skills alone predict the outcomes of actions, no matter how difficult something is or becomes during play.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Non-linearity is an important tool to weigh outcomes and set the "probabilistic tone".
                            We're using non-linearity only for "elite" aspect level in order for the jump from probability of succeeding on "difficult" tasks would jump more between "good" and "elite" skill levels.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Crunch</h3>
                            <p>
                            We have stress, squares, tactical movement, flanking, all the good stuff you'd expect. Also, since vast majority of characters have exactly 6 "HP", it adds a simple mechanism for target selection.
                            Introducing a collection of combat moves, each of which is a viable option and disseminating those among the players allows for even bigger space of options which yield interesting, dramatic and predictable tactics!
                            </p>
                            <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
                            <p>Aside from the rules listed in the left pane, there are some <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N5ZWnS2eyegwMXY2VXLIiwUj251ghhzx">additional rules</a> that can increase the resolution of your play.
                            <p>Above all, we hope that Icy NSR is easy to pick up and use to run your NSR-style game, even while running for complete beginners.
                            Focus on what's important and enjoy the ride!</p>
